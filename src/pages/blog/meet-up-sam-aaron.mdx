Last week Jon and I had the pleasure of spending the day in Cambridge
with our friend Sam Aaron, who is going to be one of our fantastic line
up of speakers this October at [XT16](https://juxt.pro/XT16.html). He'll
also be performing at the event.

Sam is a programming musician and performer who, ([according to Rolling
Stone
Magazine](http://www.rollingstone.com/music/live-reviews/moogfest-2016-was-it-actually-the-future-of-music-20160523))
\"transcends the present\". He's the author and maintainer of [Sonic
Pi](http://sonic-pi.net/), a live coding synth.

Over lunch we chatted with Sam about performing, coding and design.

# Getting away from the desk

One of the themes at XT16 this October will be how we can tap into our
natural innovation and creativity to solve problems.

> \"If you want to find your creativity, the worse thing you can do is
> sit all day at a desk.\"

Personally I can relate to that. I find that some of my more difficult
programming projects feel like hopping from one seemingly intractable
problem to another. Usually the insight which leads to progress will not
come to me while I'm at my desk but rather in the shower, in the pub or
on my bike.

# Dove-tailing features

While Sam spends most of his time in Ruby, his knowledge and experience
with Clojure has keenly influenced his work with Sonic Pi.

# The 10-year-old test

Sam had an interesting take on design. Sonic Pi is used in primary
schools to inspire children to learn to program through music.

That's a very tough ask. It means thinking about the accessibility of
everything.

# Sponsor Sam's work

Sam is currently looking for a small amount of sponsorship to help fund
his fantasitc work with Sonic Pi.
