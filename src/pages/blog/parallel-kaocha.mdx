Having a faster CI (Continuous Integration) feedback loop is always a
good thing, and there are at least three ways to make your tests faster:

1.  Split them in multiple jobs: This definitively makes sense when you
    have some clear distinctions, like unit/integration/end-to-end tests
    that also require different configuration or infrastructure to run.
    It creates a nice distinction and it's generally a good idea to do
    this, but it complicates the build pipeline and you can only have so
    many jobs, so it doesn't help if one of these jobs takes a long time
    to run.

    1.  Use a parallel test runner: Another option is to use a test
        runner that supports parallelism directly like
        [Eftest](https://github.com/weavejester/eftest). The advantage
        of this is that you can also use it locally, but the
        disadvantage is that your tests might need to be adapted to be
        run in parallel, which is sometimes tricky especially if you
        have lots of side effects.

    2.  Use the parallelism features provided by CircleCI: If one of the
        jobs still takes too long, and you're running your tests on
        CircleCI, you can also just use [CircleCI parallelism
        features](https://circleci.com/docs/2.0/parallelism-faster-jobs/).
        This accomplishes a similar result that you would achieve with
        option 2. but it's easier and doesn't require lots of potential
        work on the tests.

# Kaocha and parallel tests

I won't show examples of options `1` and `2` but dive directly into
option `3`, showing how to accomplish CircleCI parallelism using
[Kaocha](https://github.com/lambdaisland/kaocha) as test runner.

To accomplish that you will need to:

- Generate a test plan with `kaocha.repl/test-plan`

- Use the `circleci` command (available automatically in CI) to split
  the tests

- Run the tests with `kaocha.repl/run`

- Add the CircleCI configuration to specify the number of parallel
  containers to run

Let's look step-by-step at all the code and configuration you'll need.

First create a namespace like `circleci-parallel`, which will be the
entry point for your tests:

```clojure
(ns circleci-parallel
  (:require [clojure.string :as s]
            [clojure.java.shell :as sh]
            [kaocha.repl :as kr]
            [kaocha.testable :as kt])
  (:gen-class))
```

Now we need to have a function that extracts all the test namespaces,
like:

```clojure
(defn extract-namespaces []
  (->>  (kaocha.repl/test-plan)
        kt/test-seq
        (filter #(= :kaocha.type/ns (:kaocha.testable/type %)))
        (map :kaocha.testable/id)
        sort))
```

What this does is to loop over all the tests, extract just the
namespaces and return their id, so it would return something like.

`(:project.bla-test :project.foo-test)`

**_Pro tip: in any non-trivial project never print out or manually
manipulate the `test-plan` yourself (it's a massive and nested data
structure), but use the kaocha helper functions like
`kaocha.testable/test-seq` and the helpers from the `kaocha.hierarcy`
namespace._**

Now that we have a list of all the namespaces we can use the CircleCI
command (which will be automatically available) to split the tests by
timing.

To do that we just shell out to CircleCI passing the namespaces in the
standard input, and it will return a different list of namespaces to
each process automatically.

```clojure
(defn split-tests
  []
  (-> (sh/sh "circleci"
             "tests"
             "split"
             "--split-by=timings"
             :in (s/join "\n" (map name (extract-namespaces))))
      :out
      (s/split #"\n")))
```

Then we need the main function, where we just use `kaocha.repl/run` to
execute the tests, and exit with a status code = 1 if any test failed.

```clojure
(defn -main
 [& _args]
 (let [result (apply kr/run
                     (conj (vec (split-tests))
                           {:plugins                             [:kaocha.plugin/junit-xml]
                            :kaocha.plugin.junit-xml/target-file "test-results/kaocha/results.xml"}))]
   (System/exit (if (or (pos? (:kaocha.result/error result))
                        (pos? (:kaocha.result/fail result)))
                  1
                  0))))
```

A correct `System/exit` call is
not trigger a failed build in CircleCI. We also set the `junit-xml`
plugin to be able to generate the test summary in case something goes
wrong.

Now, the last thing you need is the correct CircleCI configuration,
setting the `parallelism` value to the number of parallel processes you
want to run.

```yaml
run-tests:
  parallelism: 4
  docker:
    - image: <your-image>
  working_directory: ~/<your-project>
  steps:
    - checkout
    - run: lein run -m your-project.ci-tests
    - store_test_results:
        path: test-results
```

And that's all. Your tests will now run in 4 separate processes (so 4
times faster in the best possible scenario), while still generating a
single report.

I've put together a very trivial project to see how it all works in
[this repository](https://github.com/AndreaCrotti/parallel_tests).

As you can see from the [CircleCI
steps](https://app.circleci.com/pipelines/github/AndreaCrotti/parallel_tests/5/workflows/4c24f937-92d9-4145-8db1-28c5de7622ae/jobs/5/steps)
the tests were running in two containers in parallel, and each container
had test failures, but the results were merged
[here](https://app.circleci.com/pipelines/github/AndreaCrotti/parallel_tests/5/workflows/4c24f937-92d9-4145-8db1-28c5de7622ae/jobs/5/tests)
so the report was still complete.
