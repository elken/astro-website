At XT16 [Håkan Råberg](https://github.com/hraberg) took us on a personal
search for simplicity. He told us of his journey to write a Scheme in
x86-64 assembly, revealing what he had discovered from a technical and
philosophical viewpoint. Did he find what he was looking for? Watch his
talk to find out.
