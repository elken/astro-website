One of the most important moments of my Clojure journey was when my
colleague - H책kan R책berg - had the audacity to suggest that we should
try Clojure because it might be enjoyable to do so. This earned him a
reprimand from a colleague: \"We are not paid to enjoy ourselves\".
Hakan's calm response was this: \"You're right - we're not paid to enjoy
ourselves. But then it doesn't _hurt_\".

This has stayed with me. You can put up many arguments for wanting to
use Clojure - immutability, functional idioms, simplicity etc, but in
truth I code Clojure because I enjoy it.

I feel conflicted to say this. There's an attraction to say that
enterprise software shouldn't be fun, that it needs to be difficult and
challenging enough as to warrant adequate compensation.

This is an extremely outdated view. Just taking an introspective look at
our own lives as developers it's clear: that when we enjoy what we do,
we're many times more productive. And when we're productive, everyone
benefits.

At JUXT we're hosting a one day curated conference on October 6th, and
the theme is \*\*having fun with technology\*\*.

This theme was inspired by one of our speakers - Portia Tung - founder
of [The School of Play](http://www.theschoolofplay.org), dedicated to
promoting happier adulthood through lifelong play. She takes play
seriously, asserting that companies with a playful culture do much
better overall, with their employees wanting to take more risks and to
operate with reduced stress and greater enjoyment. Portia's highly
entertaining talk will explore just how vital _play_ is in unblocking
our creative processes, and to help us have a happier life, inside and
outside of work.

This gelled with me. Programming to a certain extent is all about
playing; using our imagination to solve problems. When we're in _flow
mode_ and our career is working, then programming is one of the best
jobs in the world.

Looking at our conference it's all about having fun with technology.

Whether it be Karsten Schmidt creating playful 3D WebGL renderings via
ClojureScript, or H책kan R책berg making a personal search for the bounds
of simplicity by creating a Scheme that compiles direct to assembler,
Sam Aaron on performance coding, all of our speakers - even those taking
the philosophical high-ground and surveying the state of the industry -
are all having fun with tech. This is our theme, and it's what we want
to share.
