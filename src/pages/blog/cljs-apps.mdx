# The world needs enlightenment

I was asked recently by a colleague - let's call him Stathis S for
anonymity's sake... no wait, let's call him Mr S. Sideris - how I put
front-end apps together. He wanted, in particular, to understand why he
should consider using [re-frame](https://github.com/Day8/re-frame) for a
new project. I was in a similar situation a few years ago and after
reading the re-frame introduction several times I still didn't quite get
it so I went ahead without it, using just
[Reagent](https://reagent-project.github.io/) for rendering and my own
code for managing all the data and state.

This worked fine at first, but we had growing pains and I found that
some repetitive boilerplate code was emerging. At this point I went back
to re-frame and this time it just clicked - it was the implementation we
had been slowly approaching ourselves, but properly thought-out and
refined.

It's not just about replacing our code with re-frame's, though -
re-frame changed the way I thought about the app, how it was structured
and presented opportunities to make the tests better. I've had the good
fortune to build four new apps for a client over the last three years
and now would like to share the approach refined over that time which
promotes simple code, comprehensive testing and ability to scale (by
which I mean add features) without it becoming a big tasty bowl of
spaghetti.

With whimsy as our staff and japery as our compass, let us begin.

# Gimme one vision

Imagine we are building a typeahead. There are currently 614 typeahead
libraries available on Github, so what we need is a single universal
typeahead library to supercede them all.

A typeahead typically involves several things:

- Local state (what the user types)

- Data from the server (the suggestions that match what the user
  typed)

- An input box on the screen for the user to type into

- A display of suggestions on the screen for the user to select

We would like the typeahead to look something like the following,
prejudiced as we are by the 614 typeahead implementations we've seen on
our journey down the infinite scroll of the internet. If we make ours
look broadly similar [people will already know how to use
it](/blog/posts/re-learn.html) - a design principle called familiarity,
if you're familiar with the term.

import typeVision from '../../assets/blog/typeahead-vision.png'

<Image alt='image' src={typeVision} />

Before we get going, you'll need the following things:

- A Clojurescript project with Reagent, re-frame and Figwheel so we
  can develop with instant feedback

- Your favorite browser all ready to fig and wheel

- An empty washing up liquid bottle

- A ruler

- 8 paperclips

You can use the [figwheel-main
template](https://rigsomelight.com/figwheel-main-template/) to get the
first two things. The others are available on my eBay shop with

# Isolate the view

You might think of your application being used as follows:

import user from '../../assets/blog/user.svg'

<img src={user} />

And you could test it like this:

import bbt from '../../assets/blog/blackbox-testing.svg'

<img src={bbt} />

There are problems here:

- Delving into nested HTML structures to make assertions is
  complicated, difficult to read, prone to breaking and still doesn't
  tell you if the display makes any sense to the user - a CSS class
  might render the whole thing invisible!

- To make the UI display what we want we have to \"drive\" it with
  clicks and typing - very arduous to reach a deep corner case

- It's hard to make assertions on the photons that might hit the
  user's eyeball, a complicated and mercurial API with millions of
  years of hacks, workarounds, new features and bugs and no decent
  drivers

- If the server starts returning different data we have no way of
  knowing if our app will break

- We are tempted to complect the rendering of our data with the
  management of it, which makes it hard to test

- Our data can end up scattered in closed-over atoms preventing code
  reuse and tooling

We would like to separate the eyebally bit out and sandbox it so that it
doesn't pollute the rest of our code, which deals with pure computery
data. Let's split the UI into two parts - the data model (mmmm, fresh!)
and the view (full of the sticky goo found in eyeballs) which has only
one job - _representing_ the data to the user.

import splitting from '../../assets/blog/splitting-ui.svg'

<img src={splitting} />

# The spec

The boundaries in our code are a good place to test - the model deals
purely with data and is testable by normal means and the view deals
purely with HTML and requires a different testing methodology. It
therefore makes sense to introduce checks at the boundary between these
two, where the output of the model is consumed by the view. I can define
this as a spec:

import uiSpec from '../../assets/blog/ui-spec.svg'

<img src={uiSpec} />

Which will look something like this:

```clojure
(s/def ::query (s/nilable string?))
(s/def ::loading? boolean?)
(s/def ::value string?)
(s/def ::values (s/coll-of ::value))
(s/def ::suggestions (s/nilable (s/keys :req-un [::loading?]
                                        :opt-un [::values])))

(s/def ::component
  (s/keys :req-un [::query ::suggestions]))
```

Then I can build my model so that it outputs this data and my view so
that it consumes this data.

# A model

import zoo from '../../assets/blog/zoolander.png'

<Image alt='image' src={zoo} />

The [re-frame documentation](https://github.com/Day8/re-frame) has
colorful descriptions on how data flows like the water cycle. Your
state of the world is used to render your app. The user, seeing the app,
interacts with it and generates an event. The event is folded into the
current state of the world to produce the next state of the world, which
renders an updated view to the user and they can interact further. The
whole cycle goes on forever, consuming events and rendering updates,
growing like a black hole engulfing the universe, destabilising entire
galaxies with its infinite gravity well and spewing radiation until
eventually your Chrome tab runs out of memory.

import snap from '../../assets/blog/aww-snap.png'

<Image alt='image' src={snap} />

For our typeahead the water cycle / black hole of death will deal with
all the parts of our UI that don't involve goo.

We can encode this flow of data using re-frame's two main concepts -
event handlers and subscriptions. If you are unfamiliar with these I
suggest you first read the informative and entertaining [re-frame documentation](https://github.com/Day8/re-frame) before returning here
to pick up where you left off. I'll work on some of my side projects in
the meantime. _Watches 2 episodes of Better Call Saul..._ Welcome back!
Shall we begin?

We have a few events that can occur: the user types something, we ask
the server for some suggestions, the response from the server arrives
and the user chooses a suggestion. Every time an event happens we store
some data in the database. Note that all these events, with the
exception of asking the server, happen asynchronously in real life.

```clojure
;; user types something (and we ask the server for some suggestions)
(re-frame/reg-event-fx
 ::on-query
 (fn [{:keys [db]} [_ q]]
   (merge
    {:db (-> db
             (assoc-in [:typeahead :query] q)
             (assoc-in [:typeahead :suggestions] {:loading? true}))}
    (if (string/blank? q)
      {:dispatch [::on-suggestions []]}
      {:dispatch [::server/fetch-suggestions q [::on-suggestions]]}))))

;; server responds with some suggestions
(re-frame/reg-event-db
 ::on-suggestions
 (fn [db [_ suggestions]]
   (assoc-in db [:typeahead :suggestions] {:loading? false
                                           :suggestions suggestions})))

;; user chooses a suggestion
(re-frame/reg-event-db
 ::on-choose
 (fn [db [_ suggestion]]
   (assoc-in db [:typeahead] {:query suggestion})))
```

Now we need a way to get the data out of our re-frame database so that
our view can render it. That's what subscriptions are for:

```clojure
(re-frame/reg-sub
 ::suggestions
 (fn [db [_ query]]
   (get-in db [:typeahead :suggestions])))

(re-frame/reg-sub
 ::query
 (fn [db [_ query]]
   (get-in db [:typeahead :query])))

(re-frame/reg-sub
 ::typeahead
 (fn []
   [(re-frame/subscribe [::query])
    (re-frame/subscribe [::suggestions])])
 (fn [[query suggestions]]
   {:query query
    :suggestions suggestions}))
```

Now that all our data eggs are in the re-frame basket it's easy to write
meaningful tests and we can benefit from other aspects like tooling
(e.g. [re-frame-10x](https://github.com/Day8/re-frame-10x)), logging,
dump and restore and more.

## Model tests

We can use our spec to assert that, regardless of what the user types in
or what the server returns, the main `::typeahead` subscription always
returns data that satisfies it.

```clojure
(defn- stub-server-response [expected-request response]
  (re-frame/reg-event-fx
   ::server/fetch-suggestions
   (fn [_ [_ q callback]]
     (is (= expected-request q))

     {:dispatch (conj callback response)})))

(deftest querying-test
  (run-test-sync
   (stub-server-response "foo" ["bar"])

   (let [t (re-frame/subscribe [::model/typeahead])]
     (testing "user types something"
       (re-frame/dispatch [::model/on-query "foo"])

       (is (= {:query "foo"

               :suggestions {:loading? false
                             :values ["bar"]}} @t))
       (is (s/valid? ::spec/component @t))))))
```

This demonstrates not only that my model code outputs data that fits the
spec, but also makes a hard-to-test asynchronous call to the server
behave synchronously using the stub. This is a feature of
[day8/re-frame-test](https://github.com/Day8/re-frame-test) and is
really useful in making complicated models easily testable. It also lets
me test the transient state of the data being requested but no response
received:

```clojure
(deftest loading-suggestions-test
  (run-test-sync

   (re-frame/reg-event-fx
    ::server/fetch-suggestions
    (fn [_ [_ q callback]]
      (is (= "foo" q))

      ;; do not dispatch callback in order to observe the state before the server has returned a response
      {}))

   (let [t (re-frame/subscribe [::model/typeahead])]
     (testing "user types something"

       (re-frame/dispatch [::model/on-query "foo"])

       (is (= {:query "foo"

               :suggestions {:loading? true}} @t))
       (is (s/valid? ::spec/component @t))))))
```

Tests don't need to run asynchronously with complicated locking or
suffer from race conditions because with re-frame we've separated the
what from the when. Now we have covered the following parts in testing:

import modelTesting from '../../assets/blog/model-testing.svg'

<img src={modelTesting} />

# The goo

The view is where our data meets a random load of HTML which will
hopefully present the data in a way that makes sense to the user. The
best way of testing that is to just render something and have a look at
it! Let's write some Reagent code to manifest our vision in html tag
form:

```clojure
(defn- suggestions [{:keys [loading? values] :as any?}]
  (when any?
    [:div.suggestions
     (if loading?
       [:div.loading "Loading suggestions..."]
       (if (seq values)
         [:ul
          (map-indexed
           (fn [i v]
             [:li {:key (str i v)
                   :on-click #(re-frame/dispatch [::model/on-choose v])} v])
           values)]
         "No suggestions found, please try another search"))]))

(defn typeahead-component [model]
  [:div.typeahead
   [:input {:type "text"
            :value (:query model)
            :placeholder "Start typing to see suggestions"
            :on-change #(re-frame/dispatch [::model/on-query (.. % -target -value)])}]
   [suggestions (:suggestions model)]])

(s/fdef typeahead-component
        :args (s/cat :model ::spec/component))

(defn typeahead []
  (let [model (re-frame/subscribe [::model/typeahead])]
    (fn []
      [typeahead-component @model])))
```

Notice how simple it is - no changing of the data as it gets passed
around, just pure transforming functions to represent the data directly
in HTML.

## View tests

I use [devcards](https://github.com/bhauman/devcards) to exercise the
view code, and for assertions I use my gooey eyes. Devcards makes this
practical because it allows me to render many permutations of data, so
that I can build a screen showing all my visual edge cases in one go. I
know I am using realistic data in these cards because I can check it
against my spec, and I can ensure this by turning on instrumentation so
that it will blow up if my test data drifts from the spec.

```clojure
(defn- typeahead* [m]
  (if (s/valid? ::spec/component m)
    [typeahead-component m]
    [:div.error
     [:h4 "Bad input"]
     [:pre [:code (s/explain-str ::spec/component m)]]]))

(defcard-rg typeahead
  [:div
   [:h1 [:i "Initial state"]]
   [typeahead* {:query nil
                :suggestions nil}]

   [:h1 [:i "Loading suggestions"]]
   [typeahead* {:query "my computer is a"
                :suggestions {:loading? true}}]

   [:h1 [:i "Some suggestions"]]
   [typeahead* {:query "my computer is a"
                :suggestions {:loading? false
                              :values ["My computer is acting weird" "My computer is a potato"]}}]

   [:h1 [:i "No suggestions"]]
   [typeahead* {:query "bz"
                :suggestions {:loading? false
                              :values []}}]])
```

import dCards from '../../assets/blog/devcards.png'

<Image alt='image' src={dCards} />

I can now go one step further and try to render randomly generated data
using the spec:

```clojure
(defcard-rg generated-typeahead
  (let [models (gen/sample (s/gen ::spec/component))]
    [:div
     (map-indexed (fn [i m]
            [:div {:key i}
             [:pre (pr-str m)]
             [typeahead* m]])
          models)]))
```

I quickly found that I had React problems with duplicate keys if the
same suggestion appeared multiple times. It also forced me to consider
what to do if a suggestion was an empty string, because that looks
really weird:

import gCards from '../../assets/blog/generated-devcards.png'

<Image alt='image' src={gCards} />

With some fixes in place for that, I now know that

- my model always outputs data conforming to my spec

- my view can properly display any data that conforms to the spec

import dCardsTesting from '../../assets/blog/devcards-testing.svg'

<img src={dCardsTesting} />

## Automatic for the people

Reviewing devcards by eye before a release isn't too onerous, but it's
still easy to forget and then harder still to track down which change
broke the UI. Automating this step is the natural way to go, and with a
combination of chrome headless and imagemagick it's possible to capture
screenshots and diff devcards against reference versions. I have written
a library to do this called [kamera](https://github.com/oliyh/kamera),
which I introduce in [my next post here](visual-testing.html).

import modelView from '../../assets/blog/model-view-testing.svg'

<img src={modelView} />

# 998... 999...

The final pieces of the puzzle are at the server/model boundary. If we
knew what sort of data the server might return then we could prove our
model can handle it, and if our model can handle it we know our UI can
display it.

Some API technologies are self-describing - among them GraphQL and
Swagger (OpenAPI). I have written data generation libraries for both of
these: [lacinia-gen](https://github.com/oliyh/lacinia-gen) and
[martian-test](https://github.com/oliyh/martian/tree/master/test)
respectively, allowing you to generate data that your server will return
as an input to your model tests.

We now know that

- Whatever data our server generates (or the user provides), our model
  can accept as input

- Whatever its input, our model can output data conforming to the spec

- If the data conforms to the spec, our view code can display it
  correctly

The transitive property of our tests proves that we can render
everything properly, our application works as expected and we can add
\"full stack testing\" to our CV.

import fStackTesting from '../../assets/blog/full-stack-testing.svg'

<img src={fStackTesting} />

As a bonus, we also know that:

- If the server API changes we can run our model tests to find out if
  we need to make changes

- If we do need to change our model code we won't need to touch the
  view code

- If we just want to change how some data is represented we only need
  to change the view code

Ahh, the bonus, the deep bonus. I don't know if you heard me counting, I
did over a thousand.

# Conclusion

With some separation of concerns, introduction of code boundaries and
assertions made at each boundary we can improve the way we build and
test our apps. Our model is simple because its one job is managing how
events alter our state and delivering that data to the view, and our
view is simple because its one job is representing that data in HTML.
It's a bit like how a ship is built - each compartment is watertight and
small enough that if any one of them is breached it can be sealed off to
stop the ship sinking.

On that rather apt metaphor for software development, I'll just recap on
the libraries and tools used:

- Model it: [re-frame](https://github.com/Day8/re-frame),
  [re-frame-test](https://github.com/Day8/re-frame-test)

- Gen it: [martian](https://github.com/oliyh/martian) ([blog
  post](/blog/posts/advanced-martian.html)),
