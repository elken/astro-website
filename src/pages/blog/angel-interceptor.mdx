Much of the code I write involves a webserver - whether delivering a UI,
a public API, just some simple stats and health checks, or all three -
which means that I often rely on middleware for a lot of non-functional
requirements.

Web server middleware, or interceptors in Pedestal nomenclature, are the
bits of code that run before or after handling a request. One of the
most simple but valuable implementations is the JSON coercer, which
detects `Content-Type: application/json` on the request and decodes the
JSON body into a Clojure data structure, and encodes a Clojure data
structure response into JSON for `Accept: application/json`.

With a standard Ring/Compojure stack you only get to specify middleware
in an \"all or nothing\" approach where all middleware is executed on
every request - if you want something more specific, you either need a
hand-rolled route matcher to test scope (potentially duplicating your
routing logic) or you have to use something like Liberator which makes
it somewhat easier but [comes with its own pitfalls](http://davidjameshumphreys.github.io/patterns-pitfalls-liberator).

I've seen webserver middleware stacks take on frightening proportions,
towering unsteadily over the handling code like a game of Jenga in the
final stages.

```clojure
(def app
  (-> (var api)
      (handler/api)
      (wrap-reload '(my-ns.core))
      ... 15 more ...
      (ring-json/wrap-json-body {:keywords? true})
      (ring-json/wrap-json-response)
      ... even more ...))
```

Working with the code can feel like a game of Jenga, too - reorder some
of the calls, or add a new one, and you may break the whole thing:
something elsewhere in the call chain has had its assumptions about what
the request or the response look like broken.

Large middleware stacks also pollute every stacktrace. If we came across
a call stack 30 levels deep in our own code, we'd probably refactor it.
Why should middleware stacks be any different?

# The Pedestal paradigm

Pedestal allows you to specify interceptors that apply to just a subset
of routes, as well as \"catch all\". They are declared inline with your
routes so you don't have to repeat yourself.

Imagine you are building an API for integration with multiple chat
services. You can put `slack-auth` and `hipchat-auth` as interceptors on
the appropriate route branches while `catch-all-interceptor` is declared
as part of the service.

```clojure
(defroutes routes
  ["/api"
    ["/slack" ^:interceptors [slack-auth] ...]
    ["/hipchat" ^:interceptors [hipchat-auth] ...]])

(def service
  {:io.pedestal.http/routes routes
   :io.pedestal.http/interceptors [catch-all-interceptor ...]})
```

The interceptors are applied in order of declaration, starting from
\"catch all\", out along the branches of your routes and finally at the
leaf handler. This leads to a wonderful realization:

<Image alt='image' width={300} src={handlersRealisation} />

This allows you to write simpler interceptors that don't have to worry
about their scope, know nothing about routing and can just deal with the
\"happy path\", making code much more enjoyable to work with. I
recommend [an excellent talk by Frankie Sardo](https://skillsmatter.com/skillscasts/6812-pedestal-new-wave) on
Pedestal if you're interested in learning more.

# Rule driven

Unfortunately the scope of your interceptors is still not quite the
whole story. The ordering of your interceptors can still be important,
which is not necessarily a bad thing (it keeps each interceptor single
purpose) but it does impose additional constraints.

Considering the example above, imagine you want to limit the number of
times each account can use your API, so you add an interceptor
`rate-limiter` which applies to all routes in the API. It requires an
`account-id` to see if the account has exceeded its limit and runs
before the handler to avoid performing mutating or expensive operations.

```clojure
(defroutes routes
  ["/api" ^:interceptors [rate-limiter]
    ["/slack" ^:interceptors [slack-auth] ...]
    ["/hipchat" ^:interceptors [hipchat-auth] ...]])
```

In Pedestal the `rate-limiter` interceptor will run _before_ the
`slack-auth` or `hipchat-auth` interceptors, so the `account-id` will
not be available. However, interceptors (and pretty much everything
else) in Pedestal are defined in data structures, which means we can
reorder them at compile time or even run time if we wish.

**[Angel Interceptor](https://github.com/oliyh/angel-interceptor)** is a
tiny library I wrote to solve this scenario. It allows you to express a
_provides_ and _requires_ relation between interceptors:

```clojure
(defroutes routes
  ["/api" ^:interceptors [(angel/requires rate-limiter :account)]
    ["/slack" ^:interceptors [(angel/provides slack-auth :account)] ...]
    ["/hipchat" ^:interceptors [(angel/provides hipchat-auth :account)] ...]])
```

Angel Interceptor will then reorder your interceptors such that
`rate-limiter` will run immediately _after_ `slack-auth` or
`hipchat-auth`. To do this, simply run `angel/satisfy` over the service
map:

```clojure
(def service
  (angel/satisfy
    {:io.pedestal.http/routes routes}))
```

No more wondering which interceptors might rely on others - it's
declared right there in the code, and allows you to specify both the
scope and the relative ordering of any given interceptor.

[Angel Interceptor is on Github](https://github.com/oliyh/angel-interceptor), feedback and
contributions are very welcome.
