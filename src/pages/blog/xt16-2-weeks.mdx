It's less than two weeks to go until XT16 - our one day conference on
Thursday, 6th October.

The T-shirts are at the factory, the beer is brewed and bottled, and the
beer glasses have been delivered, we're in the process of tuning the
Ukes. The installation of the espresso machine has been planned, the hog
roast has been ordered (along with vegetarian and vegan options), the
axes, the bows and arrows and lots more besides. There's a lot going on
behind the scenes but we think we've covered everything (at least we
hope so!)

We're really pleased that many of our guests are flying in for the event
and we're confident it's going to be a day to remember.

Above all we're excited about our speakers. We've produced a programme
we feel will be imaginative, informative, inspiring and sometimes
challenging for our guests. The theme of the conference is _Technology
at Play_, combining the ideas that working with technology can be
playful, the importance of nurturing our creativity and the serious role
technology will play in our lives ahead. [See the programme
here](https://juxt.pro/XT16.html#programme).

The venue is set in the countryside in a secured automotive testing
facility; if nothing else the experience will be unique.

For those of you who are staying in The Hub MK the evening before, we've
got a reservation at the [Banana
Tree](http://www.bananatree.co.uk/locations/milton-keynes/)
restaurant/bar nearby for 9pm and we look forward to welcoming you.

We're very nearly sold out - we have but a handful of tickets left
before we meet our strict ceiling. If you'd like to come then please
[see our ticket page here](https://juxt.pro/XT16.html#xt16-ticketbooth).
See you in two weeks!
