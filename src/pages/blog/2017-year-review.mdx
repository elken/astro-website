Happy 2018 everyone!

2017 was a busy year at JUXT. We've bedded down and focused on delivery
for our core clients, but we've also moved office, attended and spoke at
various conferences, continued work on our open source libraries,
launched new training courses, and we've been hiring some amazing people
and growing.

Over the past year we have invested in compliance for our cloud
environments, ensuring that our systems meet various regulatory
criteria. This will be an important area for us and the industry going
forward, and we're very pleased to have made significant progress.

The backbone of the work involves making all our cloud deployments
_infrastructure as code_. We use Clojure to generate our cloud
descriptions, and tools such as CloudFormation and Terraform to do the
subsequent heavy lifting. I talked about the approach our team use here
at
[ClojureX](https://skillsmatter.com/conferences/8783-clojure-exchange-2017#program),
and the libraries [Mach](https://github.com/juxt/mach) and
[Roll](https://github.com/juxt/roll) which have been spawned out of the
approach (Malcolm [spoke about Mach at Dutch Clojure
Days](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RRoJaOs-K6U)).

On a different tack we have used GraphQL on multiple projects and we
have tackled the challenge of opening up _enterprise data_ for query, in
one case using Datomic as an indexing tool on top of an existing data
fabric in a large financial institution. Datomic is attractive in this
regard for its ease of declaring additive schemas, graph query
capability, and for speed of data retrieval via the Peers.

GraphQL excites us for the ability to provide a centralised, enterprise
level query capability, which is so often lacking, where data is usually
spread about into various isolated data stores and made difficult to
access. The approach of GraphQL is no silver bullet, and there will be
subsequent challenges such as schema versioning and management, but we
believe it's a major step forward. It can be a game changer to give
humans intuitive tools for exploring data, built upon an
industry-adopted data access standard.

Aside from project work, it's been fun to objectively watch the Clojure
community and tooling evolve. We've seen many new companies using
Clojure, the industry adoption of Clojure feels mildly exponential.

I met a lot of developers when I worked for ThoughtWorks a decade ago,
and I still lurk on their alumni mailing lists. From this and many
conversations I've had in general, it still feels like Clojure is a hot
language that developers want to use and to recommend. The types debate
will always divide (although for me Rich Hickey put the argument to the
sword in his [recent Clojure conj keynote
talk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2V1FtfBDsLU)), but Clojure does
have a rigorous philosophical underpinning of simplicity and
immutability that intuitively feels _right_ to a lot of people.

The tooling continues to improve, a hot of the presses example being a
speed-up [release of CIDER](https://github.com/clojure-emacs/cider/releases/tag/v0.16.0), not
to mention all the ClojureScript explosion of goodness we have seen
recently. Clojure is 10 years old now, and whilst the extremely laggard
organizations will always be conservative in language selection up until
the last possible moment, the bulk of the industry - including
[NASA](https://github.com/nasa/Common-Metadata-Repository) - is
embracing the parens.

To conclude, we're looking forward to another year of building software
using the amazing tools that the community has served up in spectacular
fashion. It's becoming clearer, that when the tools are available, you
can build software faster and more honestly, giving the users what they
want without getting bogged down in heavyweight processes and subsequent
large scale team management issues. The good tech and the good people
hang together, and we need both.

Happy 2018!
