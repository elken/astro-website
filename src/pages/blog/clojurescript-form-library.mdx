# Why did I build a new form tool?

For the past year, I have been leading the frontend development of a
couple of projects that make heavy use of forms. When trying some of the
many ClojureScript form libraries out there, I often faced situations
where I wished I had either more control over the style or more
customization power around the input handlers.

import logo from '../../assets/blog/fork-logo.jpg'

<Image alt='image' src={logo} width={100} />

Long story short, I decided to build
[**Fork**](https://github.com/luciodale/fork), a lightweight piece of
software that aims at abstracting the form logic, while keeping the UI
and validation completely decoupled.

# Lessons learnt along the way

To get this form library to its current state and design, I explored
several approaches that will be summarized below.

## Local state VS global state

import fl from '../../assets/blog/form-local-global.jpg'

<Image alt='image' src={fl} />

As Re-frame was already a project dependency, the first natural thought
I had was to leverage the events and subscriptions to manage the form
state. It did not work out well for two main reasons:

- The form components needed clean up logic when unmounted, adding
  unnecessary overhead

- It did not feel right to use the global state to store values
  strictly related to a single component

As a consequence, I built the logic around a simple Reagent atom and
included Re-frame only to manage global events such as form submissions
and server errors.

## Input abstraction VS handler abstraction

import fd from '../../assets/blog/form-abstraction.jpg'

<Image alt='image' src={fd} />

As I had already seen some libraries wrapping the input component and
defining its behavior through the props, I thought this approach
deserved a shot. In my personal experience, it turned out to be a
terrible idea because the code could not scale without sacrificing
simplicity since:

- More functionality meant constantly revisiting and refactoring the
  core input function, rapidly becoming too complex and hard to
  maintain

- Custom UI styling was only partially achievable, as the API provided
  too much abstraction

For these reasons, I chose to simply abstract the input handlers and
leave the rest to the developer, achieving a thin abstraction layer.

Examples of both approaches are showed below:

### Input Abstraction

As you can see, the input component cannot be accessed directly. You
might get around this problem by having an `:attrs` map that is then
merged with the input attributes, yet the abstraction would start
becoming meaningless at this point.

```clojure
(defn- input [props]
  [:input
   (merge
    {:name (:name props)
     :value (:value props)
     :class (:class props)
     :type (:type props)
     :on-change (:on-change props)
     ...}
    (:attrs props))])

(defn input-API [props]
  [:div (:attrs-container props)
   [:label (:label props)]
   [input (merge
           {:type "text"
            ...}
           props)]])

(defn textarea-API [props]
  [:div (:attrs-container props)
   [:label (:label props)]
   [input (merge
           {:type "textarea"
            ...}
           props)]])
```

### Handler Abstraction

With this approach, the API does not wrap any component. It only
provides functions that perform all the boilerplate logic for you.

```clojure
(defn developer-code
  [{:keys [handle-change values] :as api-utils}]
  [:input
   {:name "input"
    :value (values "input")
    :on-change handle-change
    ...}])
```

## Built-in VS no validation

import fv from '../../assets/blog/form-validation.jpg'

<Image alt='image' src={fv} />

The first two releases of Fork included built-in validation. Besides
being an optional feature, the validation logic was tightly coupled to
the input handlers. As a consequence, I came to the conclusion that I
had to rework it because:

- Unwanted noise was being added to the input handlers, especially
  when the built-in validation was not being used

- Its side effects were increasing complexity in order to cover some
  edge case scenarios

The solution? To have the validation fully removed from the inner API.
Now, Fork accepts a `:validation` option that calls any **pure**
function on the form values and provides the returned data through the
`:errors` key.

# Let's have some fun!

Now that you know Fork a bit better, it's time to look at some code and
examples to leverage this library at its full.

First, download the Fork dependency locally:

<a href='https://clojars.org/fork'>
  <img
    src='https://clojars.org/fork/latest-version.svg'
    style='margin-bottom: 1em;'
  />
</a>

Then, require it in your namespace:

```clojure
(ns your.namespace
  (:require
   [fork.core :as fork]))
```

## Reading only

Easy job! We have one input `"read"` that we initiate with the value
`"Label"`.

```clojure
(defn my-form []
  [fork/form {:initial-values
              {"read" "Label"}}
   (fn [{:keys [values
                handle-change
                handle-blur]}]
     [:form
      [:label (values "read")]
      [:input
       {:name "read"
        :value (values "read")
        :on-change handle-change
        :on-blur handle-blur}]])])
```

<div class='section'>
  <div id='read'></div>
</div>

## Submitting

Let's add some logic to what we already have. We need a submit handler
and a submit button.

```clojure
(defn my-form []
  [fork/form {:initial-values
              {"read" "Label"}
              :prevent-default? true
              :on-submit #(js/alert (:values %))}
   (fn [{:keys [form-id
                values
                handle-change
                handle-blur
                handle-submit]}]
     [:form {:id form-id
             :on-submit handle-submit}
      [:label (values "read")]
      [:input
       {:name "read"
        :value (values "read")
        :on-change handle-change
        :on-blur handle-blur}]
      [:button
       {:type "submit"}
       "Submit me!"]])])
```

Note that we also want to use a `form-id` option to let Fork know about
the input elements. In this case we just take it from the props, as we
don't care about what it really is.

However, if we want to specifically set it, we only have to add a
`:form-id` key to the first argument map.

Additionally, we choose to prevent the submission default behavior not
to send a server request.

<div class='section'>
  <div id='submit'></div>
</div>

## More Examples

As you can see, Fork does not constrain your code in that its modularity
allows you to include more library functionality as you need.

For example, you might want to combine a Fork form with some custom
inputs that are completely managed by you. You can easily achieve this
by swapping into the `:state` atom that is provided by Fork.

```clojure
(fn [{:keys [values
             state
             handle-change
             handle-blur]}]
  [:form
   [:input
    {:name "read"
     :value (values "read")
     :on-change handle-change
     :on-blur handle-blur}]
   [:input
   ;; relevant code from here
    {:value (values "custom")
     :on-change
     #(swap! state assoc-in [:values "custom"]
             (-> % .-target .-value))}]
   ...])
```

library and how to use it with Re-frame, you can check out its github
repository [here](https://github.com/luciodale/fork).

To conclude, I am going to show you a mock registration Fork form with
validation, as well. Feel free to experiment and play with it.

<div class='section'>
  <div id='register'></div>
</div>
