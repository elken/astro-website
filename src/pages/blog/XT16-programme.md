Sometimes you just want to sip a coffee, strum a Ukulele and throw an
axe, all while having your mind blown by some of the best software
practitioners discussing their most recent technical endeavours, each
with the aim of putting the fun and passion back into tech.

This is what the XT16 conference on October 6th is about and the
[programme has landed](https://juxt.pro/XT16.html#programme).

In order to help us move our minds through a day of deep philosophical
insights and creative incitements, we have sourced the best coffee and
our very own labelled beer, and also we have a large consignment of
Ukuleles being shipped right now that will help us to massage our
neurons back into place for further exhilaration.

Our opening and closing keynotes will discuss the humanity of our
industry - the ever changing present and future. We have contrarian
speakers extolling the values of uber-simplicity versus advanced
cross-platform 3D graphical rendering capability.

XT16 is an intimate conference set in a highly secured automated vehicle
testing facility in a building that looks a bit like a spaceship. We
have the movers and shakers of the London IT scene coming along,
ensuring that there will be plenty of intense conversations where you
can ponder the meaning of it all.

_Tickets are limited and selling out_; book yours
[here](https://juxt.pro/XT16.html#xt16-ticketbooth).

Lastly we would like to salute our excellent sponsors; pillars of the
worldwide Clojure community. These highly successful companies are
making a better IT industry for us all.
