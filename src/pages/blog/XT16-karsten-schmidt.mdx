For the past 28 years, Karsten Schmit
([\@toxi](https://twitter.com/toxi)) has been at the forefront of
computer-generated design. We were very pleased he took time out to
speak at our XT16 conference. Below is the video of his talk.

# Design as a verb, not a noun

Karsten characterises design as a process, not an end product.

> My work is often on the boundary of commercial and art, and everything
> is pretty-much research-driven. I develop things that then inform
> other projects.

Karsten has been a _strong open-source proponent_ since 1989, (_the
beginning_), understanding the benefit of sharing his discoveries and
work with others.

> You can debug things by making small steps, a kind of _test-driven
> philosophy_.

Karsten shows a demo he created on a very limited Atari home computer,
the first time he did computer graphics at reasonable frame rates.

# Bottom up design

Karsten explains the idea of bottom-up design, which has strong
parallels with Lisp programming, an idea that Karsten says has been with
him from the start of his programming journey.

> The idea from going from nothing to big things

He goes on to show an example of starting with randomness, and then
adding constraints to create structure, and then even towards
typography.

Karsten built his own Java-based building blocks, called toxiclibs,
which he employed on numerous projects, demonstrating the breadth of
applicability of his approach, including a 144 metre LED wall.

He then further demonstrates this concept of bottom-up design by
explaining a visual programming language he created that uses just 8
different operators.

Starting with a simple seed and applying these 8 operators, complex
structures can be created. This language was used to build his art
installation at the Barbican in London.

# Forth

Karsten finishes his talk by demonstrating a browser-based Forth
development environment he has created, called Charlie. In common with
Lisp,

Forth has virtually no syntax and exploits bottom-up design principles
to gradually increase complexity.

> In Forth, we always have data first. Not actions first, _data_ first.
> Then processes which operate on data.
