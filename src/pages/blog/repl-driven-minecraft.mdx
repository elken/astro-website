In June, JUXT attended ClojureD, the fantastic annual Clojure conference
in Berlin. In the middle of the day, a number of workshops were run to
teach you about a specific idea or tool, and get you working with it. A
group of us decided to attend the 'Change the (Minecraft) World with
Code' workshop run by [Arne Brasseur](https://github.com/plexus), [Ariel
Alexi](https://github.com/ArielA147), and [Felipe
Barros](https://github.com/barrosfelipe). This post shows how we used
what we learnt in the workshop to generate images in the game and
optimized the code using [Tufte](https://github.com/ptaoussanis/tufte).

The 'Change the (Minecraft) World with Code' workshop at ClojureD 2022
(Gallery https://clojured.de/media/gallery/gallery-2022/nggallery/page/5)

Arne showed us how to interact with the Minecraft world through the
Clojure REPL! He started by showing off how we could use code to move
the player around in the world and add items to their inventory. Using
the expressive power of Clojure he was able to quickly start generating
structures in the world with only a small set of smartly composed
instructions. For his final trick, he showed us how to make chickens
explode!

The [Witchcraft](https://github.com/lambdaisland/witchcraft) project
provides a convenient API for interacting with Bukkit-based Minecraft
servers and is what was used in the workshop.

# Having a go ourselves

After showing off his REPL-driven Minecraft-ing skills, Arne left it up
to us to have a go and see what we could design. Once we had everything
setup and installed we were able to start up the server, connect to it
with the client, and jack-in to the REPL with CIDER. The workshop
[repo](https://github.com/lambdaisland/witchcraft-workshop) provides
four namespaces which demonstrate a variety of ways to utilise
Witchcraft to orchestrate the server and Minecraft world.

One of the more interesting functions provided by Witchcraft is
`nearest-material` which finds the Minecraft material which most closely
matches a given RGB color. Witchcraft provides a file of mappings
between materials and the two most prominent colors in their textures.

To determine the most appropriate material to represent a given RGB
value the `nearest-material` function calculates the color distance to
every prominent color, and selects the material for which this value is
lowest, and is therefore closest to in color space.

[Will Caine](https://github.com/djwillcaine) had the brilliant idea of
reading the pixels of an image and mapping them into the Minecraft
world, using this function to determine the most appropriate materials
to use. With a little investigation we managed to get
[ImageIO](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/javax/imageio/ImageIO.html)
to read our file and before long we had RGB values for each pixel in the
file!

# Generating images in the Minecraft world

The Minecraft world is only 319 blocks high, from bedrock to the top of
the map, so we had to scale the image so that it would fit.

Our first implementation mapped each pixel from the image to an RGB
vector lazily using `for`. From there we could specify a scale and
sample RGB values from the large array of values.

```clojure
(ns gen-image
  (:require [lambdaisland.witchcraft :as wc]
            [lambdaisland.witchcraft.palette :as palette])
  (:import (javax.imageio ImageIO)
           (java.io File)
           (java.awt Color)))

(defn img2world
  [filename coords mc-width]
  (let [buff (. ImageIO (read (File. filename)))
        img-width (.getWidth buff)
        img-height (.getHeight buff)
        rgbvec
        (for [x (range 0 img-width)]
          (for [y (range 0 img-height)]
            (let [rgbint (.getRGB buff x y)
                  color (Color. rgbint true)]
              [(.getRed color) (.getGreen color) (.getBlue color)])))
        scale-factor (/ img-width mc-width)
        mc-height (quot img-height scale-factor)]
    (for [x (range 0 mc-width)
          y (range 0 mc-height)]
      (wc/set-block
       (-> coords
           (update :x + x)
           (update :y + y)
           (assoc :material
                  (palette/nearest-material
                   (nth (nth rgbvec (* x scale-factor)) (* y scale-factor)))))))))
```

After hacking our solution together we finally managed to generate an
image in the world. But it was upside down!

import jl from '../../assets/blog/juxt-logo-minecraft-upside-down.png'

<Image alt='image' src={jl} />

```clojure
---
(nth (nth rgbvec (* x scale-factor)) (* y scale-factor)))
---
+++
(nth (nth rgbvec (* x scale-factor)) (* (- mc-height 1 y) scale-factor)
+++
```

The origin coordinate of an image read into an ImageIO buffer is located
in the top left corner of the image, not the bottom left as we had
expected. This meant that as we iterated through the y-axis of the image
we were descending towards the bottom. By inversing the y coordinates we
were able to correctly flip the image.

import jl2 from '../../assets/blog/juxt-logo-minecraft.png'

<Image alt='image' src={jl2} />

# Optimising for speed

Although our solution worked it was painfully slow to generate the
resulting image. Our first thought was that all those repeated calls to
`wc/set-block` might be slowing us down, so we refactored the code to
make use of `wc/set-blocks` to set all the blocks at once. Using
`wc/set-blocks` also has the added benefit that it is much easier to
undo generated images using `wc/undo!` as it will remove the whole image
rather than just one generated block at a time.

```clojure
(defn img2world
  [filename coords mc-width]
  (let [buff (. ImageIO (read (File. filename)))
        img-width (.getWidth buff)
        img-height (.getHeight buff)
        scale-factor (/ img-width mc-width)
        mc-height (quot img-height scale-factor)]
       (wc/set-blocks
        (for [x (range 0 mc-width)
              y (range 0 mc-height)]
          (let [rgbint (.getRGB buff (* x scale-factor) (* y scale-factor))
                color (Color. rgbint true)
                rgb [(.getRed color) (.getGreen color) (.getBlue color)]]
            [x (- mc-height 1 y) 0 (palette/nearest-material rgb)]))
        {:anchor coords})))
```

But still our solution was slow. Had we hit a hard limit? To find out
what was really going on we needed to profile the code.
[Tufte](https://github.com/ptaoussanis/tufte) is a simple profiler for
both Clojure and ClojureScript, so we added the dependency to the server
`deps.edn` and wrote some profiling code. To make use of Tufte you must
identify the forms you would like to profile by wrapping them with `p`.
Then call the function inside `profile` and observe the results.

```clojure
(ns gen-image
  (:require ...
            [taoensso.tufte :as tufte :refer (defnp p profile)])
    ...)

(defn img2world
  [filename coords mc-width]
  (let [buff (p :new-buff (. ImageIO (read (File. filename))))
        img-width (.getWidth buff)
        img-height (.getHeight buff)
        scale-factor (/ img-width mc-width)
        mc-height (quot img-height scale-factor)]
       (p :set-blocks (wc/set-blocks
        (for [x (range 0 mc-width)
              y (range 0 mc-height)]
          (let [rgbint (p :get-rgb (.getRGB buff (* x scale-factor) (* y scale-factor)))
                color (p :new-color (Color. rgbint true))
                rgb (p :rgb-vec [(.getRed color) (.getGreen color) (.getBlue color)])]
            [x (- mc-height 1 y) 0 (p :near-mat (palette/nearest-material rgb))]))
        {:anchor coords}))))

(tufte/add-basic-println-handler!
{:format-pstats-opts {:columns [:n-calls :min :max :mean :clock :total]}})

(profile
 {}
 (p :img2world (img2world "juxt-logo.png" {:x 0 :y 150 :z 0} 200)))
```

```
    pId             nCalls        Min        Max       Mean      Clock  Total

    :img2world           1    34.15s     34.15s     34.15s     34.15s    100%

    Accounted                                                   1.70m    299%

```

The results show that 98% of the time spent in the function is spent in
`nearest-material`. As we know that there is a small and constrained
range of possible values for the inputs and outputs of this function,
`memoize` can be used to effectively cache the results, mitigating the
need to perform the same calculations repeatedly. This optimization is
particularly performant in this case as the image contains only a small
range of different colors.

```clojure
---
[x (- mc-height 1 y) 0 (p (palette/nearest-material rgb))]
---
+++
(def memo-nearest-material (memoize palette/nearest-material))
...
[x (- mc-height 1 y) 0 (p (memo-nearest-material rgb))]
+++
```

```

    :rgb-vec        15,400    72.00ns    11.60μs   119.87ns     1.85ms     1%
    :new-color      15,400    20.00ns    17.50μs    43.02ns   662.46μs     0%

    Accounted                                                 825.10ms   256%

```

We can now generate the image in under a third of a second, down from 34
seconds, which is a 100x improvement. Of course, on subsequent calls the
image is generated even faster as the color-to-material mappings are
already cached. `wc/set-blocks` is now the bottleneck, so we will leave
it there.

# Have a go yourself

If you want to have a go yourself you can easily work through it on your
own by reading through the detailed workshop instructions available
[here](https://github.com/lambdaisland/witchcraft-workshop). There are
also some [YouTube
videos](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLhYmIiHOMWoGyYsWmcQN0sG40BRjnNGM3)
to help you get inspired.

Thank you to Arne, Ariel, and Felipe for the brilliant workshop, to the
organizers of ClojureD for running such a great conference, and to JUXT
for taking us to the event.
