In this tech talk, I dive into the world of incremental view maintenance with Relic, one of the most ambitious relational programming tools in the Clojure ecosystem. 

Discover how minimising the amount of state in your application can streamline your data modelling and queries, and see a small demo of how Relic could be applied in real-life scenarios. 

Whether you're a seasoned tech professional looking for a way out of the tar pit, or someone who's just starting out, this talk will provide valuable insights into the power of Relic and functional relational programming.
