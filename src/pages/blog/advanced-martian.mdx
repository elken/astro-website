My [introduction to Martian](martian.html) demonstrated its use in
simplifying code used to talk to HTTP APIs. Before reading this article
it is suggested you read that and/or [watch the ClojureX Bytes talk](https://skillsmatter.com/skillscasts/8843-clojure-bytes#video) for
an overview. Here I will describe other benefits arising from
self-describing APIs and decoupling interfaces from implementations - in
other words, letting you describe the _what_ and letting the server and
Martian take care of the _how_.

[martian-test](https://github.com/oliyh/martian/tree/master/test) is a
library which uses your Swagger definition to validate your calls and
return realistic responses without requiring a real HTTP server. This
lets you write tests with much higher coverage that will run faster and
give you greater confidence. Let's consider a somewhat naive user lookup
function:

```clojure
(defn find-user [m user-name]
  (let [user (:body (martian/response-for m :load-user {:user-name user-name}))]
    {:name (or (:name user) "Guest")
     :write-access? (not (:read-only user))}))
```

The inclusion of the HTTP request makes it tricky to test - you don't
want to have to write a stub HTTP server just for this. Of course, you
could rewrite the function to compose it in a better way, and unit test
the logic separately from the HTTP call. You might write some code that
builds the sort of response that you can pass in to your function to
test it, but then your response-building code starts to look like a stub
HTTP server too! You also run the risk of any hardcoded stub response
drifting away from the real response the server would return, making
your tests irrelevant.

Martian can use the production definition of the server's API to
generate the response, requiring no stub code and providing responses
that are always up to date. We can write the tests like this:

```clojure
(deftest find-user-test
  (testing "happy path works"
    (let [m (-> (martian/bootstrap-swagger "https://api.com" user-api-swagger-definition)
                (martian-test/respond-with :success))]
          user (find-user m "abc")]
      (is (not= "Guest" (:name user)))

      (is (instance? Boolean (:write-access? user)))))

  (testing "guest access works"
    (let [m (-> (martian/bootstrap-swagger "https://api.com" user-api-swagger-definition)
                (martian-test/respond-with :error))]
          user (find-user m "abc")]
      (is (= "Guest" (:name user)))

      (is (false? (:write-access? user))))))
```

As always, you can write your own interceptors with whatever behaviour
you want, building on top of what Martian provides but always working at
the interface level where you want to be.

Furthermore you can use **martian-test**\'s response generators to write
generative tests and explore all possible behaviour in the following
way:

```clojure
(deftest find-user-generative-test
  (let [m (martian/bootstrap-swagger "https://api.com" swagger-definition)
        p (prop/for-all [response (martian-test/response-generator m :load-user)]

                        (let [user (find-user (martian-test/constantly-respond m response))]
                          (if (= 200 (:status response))

                            (and (= (:name response) (:name user))

                                 (= (not (:read-only response)) (:write-access? user)))


                            (and (= "Guest" (:name user))

                                 (false? (:write-access? user))))))]

    (tct/assert-check (tc/quick-check 100 p))))
```

The inherent variability in the sort of responses you can get from
remote HTTP calls makes it a perfect fit for generative testing, giving
you confidence that your application will behave correctly no matter
what response the remote API throws at it.

In the wonderful world of services written by you all APIs are
self-described with Swagger and using Martian is a breeze. Towards the
edges of the map though are areas labelled \"here be dragons\" where
services written by other teams aren't quite so self-descriptive.
Wouldn't it be great if you could write an API description for these and
get all the same benefits?

A Martian record is just data. The `bootstrap-swagger` function creates
the record for you from a Swagger description but you can also create
one directly, describing the interface as data, using `bootstrap`:

```clojure
(martian/bootstrap "https://api.org" [{:route-name :load-pet
                                       :path "/pets/:id"
                                       :method :get
                                       :path-schema {:id s/Int}
                                       :response-schemas [{:status (s/eq 200)
                                                           :body {:name s/Str
                                                                  :age s/Int}}
                                                          {:status (s/eq 404)}]}

                                      {:route-name :create-pet
                                       :path "/pets/"
                                       :method :post
                                       :body-schema {:id s/Int
                                                     :name s/Str}}])
```

This means once again that you have separated the interface from the
implementation and tamed the dragon by describing it in one place,
making changes easy and documenting it to help other developers
understand it.

The use of input and output schemas ensure you can use the definition
with **martian-test** to write helpful tests for your production code.

[re-frame](https://github.com/Day8/re-frame) is a library to help you
write single page applications in Clojurescript in a way that scales.
Data is read from the application state using subscriptions, events
which reduce the old application state into a new state are fired and
handled asynchronously and side effects like HTTP requests are described
as data. Sounds good?

In the [re-frame library for HTTP](https://github.com/Day8/re-frame-http-fx) you will see that
although the HTTP call is described as data, it's actually quite
complicated data and describes both the _what_ and the _how_:

```clojure
(reg-event-fx :handler-with-http
  (fn [{:keys [db]} _]
      {:db   (assoc db :show-twirly true)
       :http-xhrio {:method          :get
                    :uri             "https://api.github.com/orgs/day8"
                    :timeout         8000
                    :response-format (ajax/json-response-format {:keywords? true})
                    :on-success      [:good-http-result]
                    :on-failure      [:bad-http-result]}}))
```

Let's use Martian to clean this up. We can describe the HTTP call in the
Martian way with just the _what_:

```clojure
(reg-event-fx :handler-with-http
  (fn [{:keys [db]} _]
    {:db (assoc db :show-twirly true)
     :dispatch [:http/request :github/orgs {:org-name "day8"} :good-http-result :bad-http-result]}))
```

Much more readable and all the HTTP details have gone! The handlers to
make this work are as simple as this:

```clojure
(reg-event-fx :http/request
  (fn [{:keys [db]} [_ operation-id params on-success on-failure]]
    {:martian/request [(:martian db) operation-id params on-success on-failure]}))

(reg-fx :martian/request
  (fn [[m operation-id params on-success on-failure]]
    (go
      (let [{:keys [status body]} (<! (martian/response-for m operation-id params))]
        (if (unexceptional? status)
          (dispatch [on-success body])
          (dispatch [on-failure body]))))))
```

You can also use re-frame's db effects to achieve such goals as tracking
all pending requests, ignoring duplicate requests while one is pending
and so on - the possibilities are endless. The latest release of
re-frame has also embraced the same interceptor model so Martian and
re-frame sit nicely together, describing events and acting on them with
interceptor chains.

I hope these examples have shown more of the benefits of separating your
interfaces from implementations and inspired you to try Martian.
