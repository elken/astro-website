In 2013 the worlds busiest newspaper website was rewritten in Clojure.
The incumbent CTO Clifton Cunningham had the technology vision of a
replacement front-end system written using a functional programming
language, that would yield the benefits of being much simpler and easier
to maintain.

The new system would have to **faster** be than the existing Java
solution, and be **more robust** and **less error prone**. The business
wanted a platform that could cater for providing different views of
content to different devices, and so extensibility was crucial.

Jon Pither of JUXT led a team to rewrite the newspaper website in
Clojure from scratch against these requirements, using data primarily
held in ElasticSearch. The team initially started with a handful of
developers, flexing up to twelve over time, as a variety of satellite
services and separate systems were incorporated into the redevelopment.
JUXT ran a series of training courses to help developers make the
transition to Clojure.

After a short period of months, the new website ran alongside the legacy
one. A custom built diagnostics and HTML comparison framework was also
deployed into production to give vital guarantees about the content
being rendered.

The new codebase was conservatively an order of magnitude smaller than
its Java / Object Oriented counterpart and made a seamless deployment
into production. This contrasts against a previously attempted rewrite
using a modern Java EE stack that was cut short.

The developers working on the project were a happy bunch, and the
project had a feel good factor about it. Whilst the Clojure project was
going on a number of modern content authoring tools were built using
Node.js, and the CTO describes the overall journey

conference.
