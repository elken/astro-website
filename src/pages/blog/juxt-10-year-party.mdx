# Backends. Where did they come from and why are they here?
> Malcolm Sparks, JUXT Co-founder & CTO

During JUXT 10-Year Anniversary, JUXT CTO Malcolm Sparks opened the internal tech talks with a Keynote on backends.

# Databases, compilers, and XTDB
> Finn Völkel, JUXT Engineer

In this tech talk, Finn looks at some similarities and not so apparent differences of compilers and databases in the context of XTDB, a bitemporal and dynamic relational database for SQL and Datalog.

# UPDATE Considered Harmful
> Jeremy Taylor

SQL is almost 50 years old and the cost of storage has decreased dramatically over its lifetime. 

In this talk, Jeremy Taylor explains why SQL's UPDATE statement is problematic in our modern context and how developers are forced to work around it. 
He also examines 'bitemporality' — a standardised model for working with versioned historical data that mitigates the need for such workarounds.

# The State of Frontend
> Alex Davis

'Frontend Web Development' has a bad reputation for being overly complex and difficult to keep up with, but is there still truth to this these days? And what tools should I use for my next (or first!) ClojureScript web application? 
Find out in this talk by JUXT lead engineer Alex Davis.

# Exploring Design
> Mike Bruce

If you haven’t had much interest in design, maybe it’s time to have another look. 
After taking what he thought would be a brief look into design, JUXT software engineer Mike Bruce found it was much more interesting and a deeper topic than he had originally thought.

# Where is the Artist in Algorithmic Art?
> Frances Jackson-Barry

How have algorithmic artists working in code challenged traditional models of artists, artworks and audiences? How could coding creatively give us a new perspective on our everyday programming? 

In her talk, software engineer Frances Jackson-Barry looks at some of the ways artists code interesting art, and how you can try out these techniques using Clojure and Quil.
