JUXT have collaborated with Mastodon C a few times to help produce
solutions for clients.

Energy Saving Trust approached Mastodon C with a small problem but one
that required custom development. They were collecting reviews from a
number of sustainability experts, who each put their responses into an
Excel spreadsheet template.

The problem was to take these spreadsheets, and quickly derive a series
of custom reports which could be accessed online by authorized parties.

This is the kind of problem that a data integration and business
intelligence (BI) tools excel at. Rather than build a system from
scratch, it may be better to address problems with existing tools. But
then how do you go about choosing from the large number available? And
once you've chosen one, how can you be sure it can do everything you
might need it to?

This build-versus-buy dilemma is a common one for IT decision makers.
Building software from scratch, using a low-level _general purpose_
language, can be risky and expensive. On the other hand buying a
solution is also risky because it might not do everything you need it
to.

Building a system using Clojure is often a good compromise. As a general
purpose programming language, there aren't many problem domains that
Clojure can't adapt to. But Clojure's dynamic language capabilities,
with its built-in data manipulation functions, make it a powerful data
integration and presentation tool in itself.

JUXT were able to demonstrate this by _delivering a complete usable
system in 10 days of effort_. Without the time to code in the data
structure, the system _automatically extracted the meaningful results_
from the reviews by _statistical analysis_, presenting the data in
custom-specified charts in a dashboard format, accessible via a _secured
web application_. This allowed the Energy Saving Trust to quickly
produce a report full of insights into the energy savings possible with
modifications to existing homes.

If you are looking to develop a custom system, but want the rapid
development associated with an _off the shelf_ data integration tool,
you should consider building on the Clojure language using developers
who know how to wield it.
