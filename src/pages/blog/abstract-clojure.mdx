A great deal can be achieved in the first few years of a software
project, with a small team and the right tools we can quickly deliver
features to appease both businesses and their clients. In the early
stages of a project, delivery is often prioritised over architecture,
but the architecture needs to evolve if the software is to be developed
and maintained in the longer term. Any project that lives for longer
than a few years will experience change, business requirements will
change, developers will come and go, platform services on which the
software depends will be deprecated and replaced, deployment
environments will change, and new technologies will offer new
possibilities as older technologies become obsolete.

Abstraction is at the heart of software architecture, separating `what`
from `how` enables us to focus on the core business problem we are
trying to solve without getting lost in the details of a particular
implementation.

# Abstraction

> Depend on abstractions, not on concretions
>
> -- Dependency Inversion Principle

Concretion is when we depend on implementations as opposed to
abstractions, consider the following application that exposes a REST API
to retrieve a blog article from a SQL database:

```clojure
(ns app.db
  (:require [next.jdbc.sql :as sql]))

(defn get-article-by-id
  "`data-source`: javax.sql.DataSource, `id`: article id"
  [data-source id]
  (sql/get-by-id data-source :article id))
```

```clojure
(ns app.server
  (:require [app.db :as db]
            [reitit.ring :as ring]))

(defn get-article [data-source request]
  (let [id (get-in request [:path-params :id])
        article (db/get-article-by-id data-source id)]
    {:status 200
     :body article}))

(defn router [data-source]
  (ring/router
    [["/api/article/:id" {:get {:parameters {:path {:id int?}}}
                          :handler #(get-article data-source %)}]]))
```

```clojure
(ns app.system
  (:require [app.server :as server]
            [next.jdbc :as jdbc]))

(defn init [db-spec]
  (let [data-source (jdbc/get-datasource db-spec) ;; javax.sql.DataSource
        router      (server/router data-source)] ;; reitit.core/Router
    ...))
```

In the example, `get-article` is coupled to the implementation
`get-article-by-id`; the router is coupled to `get-article`. The result
is a rippling effect that requires the router and the handler to be
aware of the `data-source` yet the only function that needs to know
about the `data-source` is `get-article-by-id`. We need a running SQL
database to test the current routing implementation.

We can invert the dependencies using abstraction. If we use the same
signature as `db/get-article-by-id` but remove the `data-source` we are
left with a function that takes an `id` and returns an `article`:

```clojure
(fn get-article-by-id [id]
  article)
```

We can construct an implementation of our abstraction using higher-order
functions:

```clojure
(fn [id]
  (db/get-article-by-id data-source id))

(partial db/get-article-by-id data-source)

#(db/get-article-by-id data-source %)
```

We can now pass a function to `server/get-article` where we previously
passed the `data-source`, resulting in a pure function:

```clojure
(defn get-article
 "`get-article-by-id`: (fn [id] article)"
 [get-article-by-id request]
  (let [id (get-in request [:path-params :id])
        article (get-article-by-id id)]
    {:status 200
     :body article}))
```

Following the same approach, we can remove the first parameter of
`get-article` to form our next abstraction; a request handler:

```clojure
(fn handler [request]
  response)

#(server/get-article get-article-by-id %)
```

The last change required is to the router; we need a way to pass in the
handler. Our example shows a single route, but in practice, we are
likely to have many; we can use a function that takes a `route` key and
returns a handler:

```clojure
(fn route->handler [route]
  (fn handler [request]
    response))
```

We can implement `route->handler` using a map:

```clojure
{:get-article #(server/get-article get-article-by-id %)}
```

We have now decoupled the router and handler, and removed the
`data-source` dependency:

```clojure
(ns app.server
  (:require [reitit.ring :as ring]))

(defn get-article
 "`get-article-by-id`: (fn [id] article)"
 [get-article-by-id request]
  (let [id (get-in request [:path-params :id])
        article (get-article-by-id id)]
    {:status 200
     :body article}))

(defn router
  "`route->handler`: (fn [route] (fn [request] response))"
  [route->handler]
  (ring/router [["/api/article/:id" {:get {:parameters {:path {:id int?}}}
                                     :handler (route->handler :get-article)}]]))
```

At first glance, it may seem like a small change, but the refactored
version is significantly different: the functions are now pure and can
be tested in isolation without a running database.

We can
[substitute](https://blog.thecodewhisperer.com/permalink/liskov-substitution-principle-demystified)
`get-article-by-id` for any function with the same signature without any
change to the `app.server` code. This could be a stub/mock during
testing, a wrapper that adds monitoring/logging/caching, or an
alternative implementation that fetches the article from a different
database or external source.

The router has a [single
responsibility](https://blog.cleancoder.com/uncle-bob/2014/05/08/SingleReponsibilityPrinciple.html):
routing an incoming request to a handler. The handler also has a single
responsibility: transforming the incoming request into an internal call
where the action is performed.

## Protocols

The [protocol](https://clojure.org/reference/protocols) is another form
of abstraction we can use to decouple modules, the approach is more
object-oriented than functional, but protocols can be useful where we
desire a more formal abstraction, or where it makes sense to form a
[cohesive](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cohesion_(computer_science)>)
collection of behaviours. In the previous example, we used a single
function for the abstraction to retrieve an article, alternatively, we
could use the [Repository
Pattern](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/architecture/microservices/microservice-ddd-cqrs-patterns/infrastructure-persistence-layer-design)
popularised by Domain Driven Design:

```clojure
(ns app.article-repository)

(defprotocol ArticleRepository
  (create [_ article])
  (get-by-id [_ id])
  (publish [_ id])
  (archive [_ id])
  (update-title [_ id title]))
```

```clojure
(ns app.db
  (:require [app.article-repository :refer [ArticleRepository]]
            [next.jdbc.sql :as sql]))

(defrecord SqlArticleRepository [data-source]
  ArticleRepository
  (get-by-id [_ id]
    (sql/get-by-id data-source :article id))
  ...)
```

```clojure
(ns app.server
  (:require [reitit.ring :as ring]
            [app.article-repository :as article-repository]))

(defn get-article [article-repository request]
  (let [id (get-in request [:path-params :id])
        article (article-repository/get-by-id article-repository id)]
    {:status 200
     :body article}))
```

The interface in this example is more formal in that we require the
repository namespace and refer to it directly, this is different from
the initial use of referring to the function defined via `defn` as we
refer to the abstraction, not the concretion of the protocol defined in
`app.db`.

It is more verbose, but it may be preferable to pass around instances of
protocols than to pass around lots of functions, particularly where many
behaviours are needed that are closely related; ultimately, it comes
down to a matter of style. One of the advantages of protocols over
functions is that it is clearer to the reader what a function depends
on; we `require` the namespace and our code points to where the protocol
is defined. On the other hand, this is not as flexible or as concise as
the functional alternative.

# Composition

We achieved decoupling by introducing abstractions, the next step is to
compose our functions into a system. We start by creating a
`data-source` and using an anonymous function to wrap
`db/get-article-by-id` resulting in a function `(fn [id] article)`. The
`get-article-handler` is created in the same way, resulting in a
function `(fn [request] response)` which is placed inside a map to
construct the `route->handler` abstraction:

```clojure
(ns app.system
  (:require [app.db :as db]
            [app.server :as server]
            [next.jdbc :as jdbc]))

(defn init [db-spec]
  (let [data-source         (jdbc/get-datasource db-spec)               ;; javax.sql.DataSource
        get-article-by-id   #(db/get-article-by-id data-source %)       ;; (fn [id] article)
        get-article-handler #(server/get-article get-article-by-id %)   ;; (fn [request] response)
        route->handler      {:get-article get-article-handler}          ;; (fn [route] (fn [request] response))
        router              (server/router route->handler)]             ;; reitit.core/Router
    ...))
```

One of the trade-offs with this approach is that it results in
additional wiring; functions must be passed their dependencies and wired
together to form a system. The indirection means we can no longer jump
to the definition of `get-article-by-id` in the server namespace.
Whether the trade-offs are worth it is for you to decide; the
abstraction may be premature for short-lived projects, but decoupling
can help ensure larger projects are easier to maintain.

Composing large systems can be challenging. Processes need to be started
and stopped in a particular order and the graph of dependencies can be
large when following the Dependency Inversion Principle. We often reach
out to frameworks such as
[Component](https://github.com/stuartsierra/component) or
[Integrant](https://github.com/weavejester/integrant) to help us
construct larger systems, at the time of writing Integrant is the
recommended option on our [Clojure Radar](https://www.juxt.pro/radar).

The code to construct a system with Integrant is similar to the code we
defined in the `let` binding:

```clojure
(defmethod ig/init-key ::get-article-by-id [_ {:keys [data-source]}]
  #(db/get-article-by-id data-source %))

(defmethod ig/init-key ::get-article-handler [_ {:keys [get-article-by-id]}]
  #(server/get-article get-article-by-id %))

(defmethod ig/init-key ::router [_ {:keys [route->handler]}]
  (server/router route->handler))
```

With the system declared in a map:

```clojure
{::data-source {:db-spec db-spec}
 ::get-article-by-id {:data-source (ig/ref ::data-source)}
 ::get-article-handler {:get-article-by-id (ig/ref ::get-article-by-id)}
 ::router {:route->handler {:get-article (ig/ref ::get-article-handler)}}}
```

As the system grows, we can split it up into cohesive modules, with maps
created per module, then merged to form larger systems. We can make use
of [ig/pre-init-spec](https://github.com/weavejester/integrant#specs) to
assert the dependencies are as expected:

```clojure
(s/def ::data-source #(instance? javax.sql.DataSource %))

(defmethod ig/pre-init-spec ::get-article-by-id [_]
  (s/keys :req-un [::data-source]))
```

Protocols work well here; we can validate them using
[satisfies?](https://clojuredocs.org/clojure.core/satisfies_q) and catch
wiring issues as the system is initialised:

```clojure
(s/def ::article-repository #(satisfies? ArticleRepository %))

(defmethod ig/pre-init-spec ::get-article-handler [_]
  (s/keys ::req-un [::article-repository]))

(defmethod ig/init-key ::get-article-handler [_ {:keys [article-repository]}]
  #(server/get-article article-repository %))
```

Frameworks such as Component or Integrant can help us when building
larger systems, but we should take care to keep them at the periphery,
design decisions taken by frameworks can have an impact on the design
within your project. If you find yourself forced into using a certain
data structure within your internal code to meet the restrictions of a
framework you should consider whether it is helping or hindering your
architecture.

# Stability

> Depend in the direction of stability
>
> -- Stable Dependencies Principle

Every system has stable and volatile components. In Clojure, we can
consider a function to be stable if it is [referentially
transparent](https://ericnormand.me/podcast/what-is-referential-transparency),
conversely, we can consider any function which talks to the outside
world or depends on something not referentially transparent as being
volatile.

In our example application, the database is a volatile component which
in turn makes the server and system namespaces unstable. The red arrows
on the diagram show the components that are volatile due to their
dependencies:

With the abstractions introduced, the `server` namespace no longer
depends on the volatile dependency; it is now a stable component.

The alternate implementation with the `ArticleRepository` protocol has
additional arrows shown in light green that point to the protocol:

## Example: Project Management Application

With such a trivial example the benefits of decoupling are perhaps not
so obvious, consider a more complicated example of a project management
application where users can create projects and manage tickets within a
project, with notifications sent when the ticket status changes:

The managed services are volatile components, and implementations are
required directly throughout the project, resulting in a tightly coupled
system where everything is volatile. Whilst some components within a
system must be volatile it is not desirable for everything to be
volatile.

# Layered Architectures

The Hexagonal Architecture, Onion Architecture, [Clean
Architecture](https://blog.cleancoder.com/uncle-bob/2012/08/13/the-clean-architecture.html),
and [Functional Core, Imperative
Shell](https://www.destroyallsoftware.com/screencasts/catalog/functional-core-imperative-shell)
all put high-level business logic at the core of the application and
make use of layers to keep low-level details such as the database and
transport protocols at the periphery.

We can split the project management application into layers, separating
the core domain from the implementation specifics. The result is a
`domain` layer that depends only on abstractions and has no knowledge of
external dependencies; notice that the arrows never point from the
domain to the infrastructure layer. Abstractions are implemented in the
`infrastructure` layer and wired together to form a system:

There are more nodes on the layered architecture and more edges where
abstractions have been introduced, but the graph is not as deep and all
components in the domain are now stable. The volatile components in the
infrastructure provide implementations for the abstractions in the
domain layer, the relationships within the domain layer remain the same
but are now provided via abstractions.

Abstractions are fundamental if we strive to design larger systems that
are simple and maintainable in the long term. Look at your own codebase
and see where you're tied to a certain implementation, draw a graph and
see where all the arrows point, find the volatile components and
consider introducing abstractions to decouple modules and to separate
`what` from `how`.

Software design is a well researched and understood problem, patterns
and principles have been widely adopted since the start of the century,
with many of the ideas the solutions are based on coming decades before
that. Many of the ideas are equally applicable to functional programming
and they can help us design applications that are maintainable in the
longer term.
