My previous blog covered the mathematics involved in the neural network
that we are going to write. You can find it
[here](https://juxt.pro/blog/posts/neural-maths.html). The ideas covered
in the blog are used, but a complete understanding is not necessary for
reading this blog.

You can find the
[code](https://github.com/juxt/prop/blob/master/src/prop/core.clj) from
the repository, [juxt/prop](https://github.com/juxt/prop).

# Starting the Neural Network

What are our initial variables for the construction of a neural network?

1.  Inputs

2.  Outputs

3.  Bias on each neuron

4.  Bias weights

Some of you may be thinking, we also need the weights right? Isn't that
the whole point of a neural network... to update the weights in order to
get your desired output? You are absolutely correct, the weights are
updated through each iteration. That is the precise reason why we don't
initially specify the weights, as they are going to change, so we may as
well start with a random number, between -1 and 1.

In `nn` we create our initial network with the random weights generated.

```clojure
(defn nn [input output output-bias & args]
  (let [num-bias (into [] (for [arg args] (:num arg)))
        hidden-weights (->> num-bias (partition 2 1) (mapv (partial reduce rep)))
        output-weight (conj hidden-weights (rep (-> args last :num) (count output)))
        weights (cons (rep (count input) (-> args first :num)) output-weight)]
    {:input input
     :bias (to-vector output-bias args vals)
     :weights (into [] weights)
     :bias-weights (conj (vec
                           (for [arg args]
                             (vec (butlast (keys arg)))))
                         (-> output-bias keys vec))
     :output output}))
```

We define our neural network using the above function as follows:

```clojure
(def network (nn [1 0 1]
                 [0.1 0.5]
                 {0.3 0.6 0.4 0.8}
                 {0.05 0.1 0.15 0.2 :num 2}
                 {0.25 0.3 0.35 0.4 :num 2}))
```

# Feed Forward Pass

Next we calculate the sigmoid values. We use the sigmoid values of the
previous layer, the bias, weights and bias-weights.

```clojure
(defn calc-sigmoid [{:keys [input bias weights bias-weights output]}]
  {:sig-values (loop [ind 1
                      res [(sigmoid-layer input (first weights) (first bias) (first bias-weights))]]
                 (if (>= ind (count bias-weights))

                   res
                   (recur (inc ind)
                          (conj res (sigmoid-layer (last res) (get weights ind) (get bias ind) (get bias-weights ind))))))
   :output output})
```

In this calculation we use
[core.matrix](https://github.com/mikera/core.matrix) to calculate the
net of every neuron in each layer.

```clojure
(defn net-layer [inputs weights bias bias-weights]
  (M/+
    (m/mmul
      (m/matrix [inputs])
      (m/matrix weights))
    (M/*
      (m/matrix [bias])
      (m/matrix [bias-weights]))))
```

The result is passed into the sigmoid function to get the values of the
neurons in each layer.

```clojure
(defn sigmoid-layer [inputs weights bias bias-weights]
  (mapv sigmoid (first (net-layer inputs weights bias bias-weights))))
```

At this stage we have the sigmoid values of every neuron and are able to
calculate the error on each neuron and the total error, which is the
sum. The target is the output, and the output-sigmoid is the final
vector of calc-sigmoid.

```clojure
(defn output-error [target output-sigmoid]
  (* 0.5 (- target output-sigmoid) (- target output-sigmoid)))
```

# Updating the weights

Now we get to the most interesting and difficult process in calculating
the new weights. To do this we have to recognize that each weight
depends on certain variables. So all we need to do is get these
variables.

I have used the premise that a weight connects two neurons.

import tw2 from '../../assets/blog/2-2-2-2.png'

<Image alt='image' src={tw2} />

As you can see, weight _w1_ connects neuron _i1_ to neuron _h11_. First
we want to get vectors of these links.

## Linking the Neuron

```clojure
(defnp links [{:keys [input bias weights bias-weights output] :as network}]
  (let [sig (cons input (:sig-values (calc-sigmoid network)))]
    {:weight-links (mapv #(connector (vec sig)
                                     weights
                                     (p :links-first-first (-> % first first))
                                     (-> % first second)
                                     (-> % first last))
                         (mapv #(indexer weights %) (flatten weights)))
     :sig sig}))
```

Going back to

import tw from '../../assets/blog/2-2-2-2.png'

<Image alt='image' src={tw} />

The neuron values are in a vector

```clojure
[[i1 i2] [h11 h12] [h21 h22] [o1 o2]]
```

The weights are in the vector

```clojure
[[[w1 w2] [w3 w4]]
 [[w5 w6] [w7 w8]]
 [[w9 w10] [w11 w12]]]
```

_w1_ connects _i1_ and _h11_. _w2_ connects _i1_ and _h12_.

The index of _w1_ in weights is \[0 0 0\]. The _i1_ in values is \[0 0\]
and _h11_ is \[1 0\] The index of _w2_ in weights is \[0 0 1\]. The _i1_
in values is \[0 0\] and _h12_ is \[1 1\] ...

Therefore using the index of the weight, if we say the index of _w1_,
\[0 0 0\] = \[a b c\], the the index of _i1_ is \[0 0\] = \[a b\]

and the index of _h11_ is \[1 0\] = \[(+ a 1) c\].

We can see this working with _w2_. \[0 0 1\] = \[a b c\]. _i1_ is \[0
0\] = \[a b\]. _h12_ is \[1 1\] = \[(+ a 1) c\]

Prove to yourself with the other weights to see why this works.

We use the connector function to generate these links.

```clojure
(defn connector [values weights a b c]
  [(reduce get weights [a b c])
   (reduce get values [a b])
   (reduce get values [(+ 1 a) c])])
```

## Finding the Variables

Before we can calculate the delta, we first need the variables.

```clojure
(defn delta-variables [weight network links*]
  (let [{:keys [weight-links sig]} links*
        output-sig (last sig)
        connect (list (connection weight weight-links))]
    {:delta-variables (if (p :some (some #(= (-> connect first first last) %)

                                         output-sig))
                        (mapv rest (first connect))
                        (p :loop (loop [res (mapv rest (first connect))
                                        c connect]
                                   (let [new-c (first (map (fn [x]
                                                             (map (fn [cc] (let [woutput (last cc)
                                                                                 woutput-links (connection woutput weight-links)]
                                                                             (filter #(= (get % 1) woutput) woutput-links)))

                                                                  x))
                                                           c))
                                         new-res (conj
                                                   res
                                                   (map (fn [x]
                                                          (map (fn [xx]
                                                                 [(first xx) (last xx)])
                                                               x))
                                                        new-c))]
                                     (if (some #(= (-> new-c first first last) %) output-sig)

                                       new-res
                                       (recur new-res
                                              new-c))))))
     :last-sig output-sig}))
```

This function doesn't look pretty, and I will be the first to admit that
it can be improved. The underlying theory is a weight links neuron _A_
to _B_. We check if neuron _B_ is in the final layer, i.e. the output
layer. If it is, we take the values of the two neurons.

If neuron _B_ is not in the final layer, we still take the values of the
two neurons, but, look further at neuron _B_ and get all links where
neuron B acts as neuron _A_, the first neuron. We then check if the new
neuron _B_ is the output layer. If it is, we take the weight and the new
neuron _B_. If not, we repeat the process.

## Calculating Delta

```clojure
(defn delta-value [weight {:keys [output] :as network} links*]
  (let [{:keys [delta-variables last-sig]} (p :delta-variables (delta-variables weight network links*))
        first-vars (first delta-variables)
        last-vars (last delta-variables)
        middle-vars (butlast (rest delta-variables))
        a (layer-eq first-vars)
        b (map (fn [x] (map (fn [xx] (output-eq xx output last-sig)) x)) last-vars)
        c (map (fn [x] (map (fn [xx] (map (fn [xxx] (layer-eq xxx)) xx)) x)) middle-vars)]
    (cond
      (and (nil? middle-vars) (= first-vars last-vars)) (output-eq last-vars output last-sig)

      (nil? middle-vars) (* a (first (map #(apply + %) b)))
      :else (p :cond3 (* a (first (map #(apply + %) (reduce (fn [acc v] (M/* v (map #(apply + %) acc))) b (reverse c)))))))))
```

Calculating the delta now becomes relatively straightforward as we have
the variables and we know the formulae from the [Mathematics
Blog](https://juxt.pro/blog/posts/neural-maths.html).

We have to use special cases depending on the layer though. I am going
to call the output layer the top layer, and the input layer the bottom
layer. From the `cond`, the first condition is the first layer from the
top, the second condition is the second layer from the top and then we
arrive at the general case.

## Arriving at the New Weight

```clojure
(defnp new-weight [weight network learning-rate links*]
  (let [new-value (delta-value weight network links*)]
    (- weight (* learning-rate new-value))))
```

To calculate the new weight, we multiply the delta-value with the
learning rate and take that away from the original weight. Doing this to
all the weights gives us a new set of adjusted weights for our next
iteration.

# ITERATE

The final step is the iterations. Here we use a simple loop and add some
`printlns` to keep track of the neural network while it is running.

```clojure
(defnp train [network learning-rate num-of-iterations println?]
  (loop [x 0
         v network]
    (if (>= x num-of-iterations)

      v
      (recur (inc x)
             (let [{:keys [new-weights]} (new-network-weights v learning-rate)]
               (when println?
                 (println "Total error is: " (:total-error (-> v calc-sigmoid errors)) "Iteration is: " (inc x)))
               (assoc v :weights new-weights))))))
```
