[CodeNode](https://skillsmatter.com/locations/264-skills-matter-codenode)
is a wonderful facility in London set up by our friends over at Skills
Matter, and opened its doors for the first time just last August.

For years, Skills Matter have been great supporters of our [vibrant
Clojure community](http://www.londonclojurians.org/) in London, with
their annual [Clojure Exchange
conference](https://skillsmatter.com/conferences/6861-clojure-exchange-2015)
in December being one of the highlights of the year. (Oh, by the way,
talk submissions are open for this year's Clojure Exchange, so it's a
great time to [submit a
proposal](https://docs.google.com/a/bettercities.city/forms/d/1hQDOSXSdDF22aGRbX-K5z5MZpegdmMuOVxUgO0zBwFc/viewform?edit_requested=true)).

But if you can't wait for the conference, there's a talk every month
held at Skills Matter in association with the London Clojurians. As it
turns out, next
[Monday](https://skillsmatter.com/meetups/7385-london-clojure-ug) (12th
October, 2015), 3 JUXTers are presenting talks about some of the lessons
we've learned while deploying Clojure on projects.

[Frankie](https://github.com/frankiesardo) will kick things off
explaining the _new wave_ of Pedestal, how Cognitect's Pedestal server
framework has been getting better and better over many years, and why
now might be the time to select it for your server-side Clojure project.
Frankie has been working heavily with Pedestal on a number of projects
and is the author of
[pedestal-swagger](https://github.com/frankiesardo/pedestal-swagger).

Next up, [Oliy](https://skillsmatter.com/legacy_profile/oliver-hine)
will dive in to explain how to use Pedestal Swagger and other patterns
in a fun example that's actually in production as a mission-critical
service, providing memes to our JUXT Slack!

Finally,
[David](https://skillsmatter.com/legacy_profile/david-humphreys) will
wrap up with some tips and tricks discovered in employing
[Liberator](http://clojure-liberator.github.io/liberator/) to serve the
web content on a high-performance website delivered by JUXT:
[onthemarket.com](https://www.onthemarket.com).

We'll wrap up afterwards with some Clojure discussions and beer. All
welcome, especially if you haven't attended a Clojure event before - it
will be great to meet you.
