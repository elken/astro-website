For a number of years now I've been thinking about reflecting something
Dick Gabriel remarked about Lisp [during an
interview](http://www.se-radio.net/2008/01/episode-84-dick-gabriel-on-lisp/)
on [Software Engineering Radio](http://www.se-radio.net). (5:36)

The only way to write AI programs, then (as it still is now) was by
taking an _exploratory approach_ to development.

Today, the software we develop and maintain with are far more complex
than those in the 80s. If we are to develop and maintain increasingly
complex systems, we need interactive and exploratory tools to maintain
our understanding of how they work. The best way of understanding the
world is to interact with it, not as spectators but as active
participants constantly poking and manipulating. This is what makes Lisp
and other _live programming languages_ so relevant today.

One of the best examples of a _live programming language_ is
ClojureScript with Bruce Hauman's
[Figwheel](https://github.com/bhauman/lein-figwheel) environment.

Bruce has done a great job at taking a concept and making it work for
real-world development beyond the cute demo.

# Learnable Programming

Others will have been inspired by work like Brett Victor's [learnable
programming](http://worrydream.com/#!/LearnableProgramming)

> An essential aspect of a painter's canvas and a musical instrument is
> the _immediacy_ with which the artist gets something there to react

Brett goes on to compare this artist's approach to that of the
traditional programmer:

Live programming environments capture the essence of Agile
methodologies: instant and continuous feedback.

Many examples of live programming environments are highly visual and
interactive environments, such as games. These certainly have their own
degree of complexity that exploratory programming can cut through. But
live programming environments can help in any application where humans
interact, websites for example. By making the development environment of
a website _live_ we transform our perspective to that of our users,
revealing new and relevant insights.

# App state

So let's take what we know about writing browser-based games and single
page applications in ClojureScript, and apply it to the _back-end_
(plain old websites).

Something that we've found to work well in ClojureScript applications is
keeping all the application's state in a single atom. This allows us to
treat all state as a single immutable value (which has all kinds of
benefits) but still allow mutation by allowing that value to be replaced
with new values over time. That's essentially what a Clojure atom
does -- it's a box holding a given value at a given time.

```clojure
// The app 'universe'
(def app-state
  (atom
    {:drawer {:items [{:name "ear-plugs"}]}
     :shopping
      {:items
        [{:name "Coffee" :quantity 2}
         {:name "Milk" :quantity 2}
         {:name "Bird seed" :quantity :lots}]}}))
```

Let's imagine what this state might be for a typical back-end generated
website, for example, JUXT's juxt.pro website.

```clojure
// The website 'universe'
(def app-state
  (atom
    {:data {:number-of-active-users 3
            :posts [{:title "Menu today"
                     :text "Fish and chips"
                     :comments [{:user "Frank"
                                 :text "Good, I like chips"}]}]}
     :config {:web-port 8080}}))
```

A web request for content arrives to the webserver, that is
[routed](https://github.com/juxt/bidi) to a handler.

A custom interceptor is added to the usual chain of processing
functions. This interceptor does something special: it calls `deref` on
the app-state atom. In fact, here's the actual code:

```clojure
(fn inject-state [ctx]
  (assoc ctx :state @app-state))
```

The current value of the app-state is captured and made accessible to
other interceptors to work with, including the main response function
that is responsible for generating the HTTP response. This is done by
first transforming the state into a view-model, which is the provided to
the [Selmer](https://github.com/yogthos/Selmer) templates we use on our
site.

# Keeping state up-to-date

The app state in a browser application is confined to a single atom.
That makes it quick to dereference.

The app state that a website has to represent may span multiple sources,
such as files, databases and other systems. Our approach is to model
this distribution of state as a dependency tree.

import ss from '../../assets/blog/skip-state.svg'

How can we avoid the expense of refreshing our state affecting the
performance off each request? The answer lies in the combination of two
strategies:

1.  We cache state aggressively, detecting novelty efficiently,
    top-down.

2.  We detect changes in state and proactively update the cache,
    bottom-up.

# Detecting novelty

The first strategy relies on us determining when our state is stale, and
doing so in an efficient manner. Here are some examples to explain the
general approach to detecting _novelty_:

- If part of the state is from a file, we can check the modification
  time to know if it's been modified since the last time we cached it.

- If part of our state is mastered in a git repository, we can
  determine if there is a novelty by comparing the SHA1 of the HEAD
  commit. If it is the same as our last reading, we know anything we
  have cached from information in the repository must still be fresh.

- If part of our state is an append-only log, we can detect change by
  checking the last entry of the log matches the one we noted on our
  last visit.

- If part of our state is mastered in a relational database, we might
  be able to query the SCN (system change number) or Datomic t-value.

# Proactive updates

The second strategy relies on us detecting change. These days most data
stores provide change notifications which we can harness.

- If part of our state is mastered on the file-system, use OS-level
  file-system notifications. Java 7 has the
  `java.nio.file.WatchService` service (we provide a Clojure wrapper
  for this called [dirwatch](https://github.com/juxt/dirwatch)).

- If we are using Datomic, subscribe to the transaction queue. Upon
  change, freshen the relevant state (or at least mark it as dirty).

- If we are using a relational database, use a database trigger to
  alert us to change we're interested in.

# Skip

We've promoted some of the tech we use from our website into a library
called [skip](https://github.com/juxt/skip). It's still a
work-in-progress and there's still some kinks to smooth out.

And over time we'll improve the library based on our ongoing experiments
and optimizations.

# Deploying to production

While it's great to develop the website locally with a fast feedback
loop, we also want to deploy fast. In particular, we want to be able to
push new content, blog articles and fixes and have them live as soon as
possible. Also, in these simple cases we want to avoid a rebuild,
redeployment or restart (and consequent downtime) of the website.

When we're ready to push new content we commit our changes to git and
push them to our github repository. This makes sure our changes are
integrated with those of other JUXT staffers. Then, if we're ready to
deploy, we push to production with `git push`.

The production website runs from a working tree which is automatically
updated when we push. To enable this behavior, we've configured the
production git repository to update the file-system with the latest
changes when we push.

    git config receive.denyCurrentBranch updateInstead

Any file-system changes are then picked up in the normal way and the
changes are ready for the next web request.

# Continuous Integration?

In a world where received wisdom is to rebuild and redeploy systems on
every change, no matter how small, the approach I've described here
might seem alien.

But from a different perspective, is it reasonable for us to waste
trillions of CPU cycles for every iteration of our software systems, no
matter how minor? Should we always build everything from _scratch_, and
if so, what do we mean by _scratch_ anyway?.

What is inherently wrong with building our code incrementally? Are there
ways we can determine when our systems require complete rebuild and when
they don't? And what does it mean to _build_ a software system? Can a
software system build itself, fully or partially, from within?

These are interesting questions to ponder. There seem to be no fixed
lines here, just fuzzy ones. But in a hundred years, even the idea of
_building software_ may seem like a very primitive stage in the
evolution of programming. People may legimately ask the question: what
was ever _continuous_ about continuous integration?
