# Site Safari

Site is a project we've been working on since 2020.

As with all our [open-source projects](https://github.com/juxt), Site was conceived out experiences in our project work with our JUXT clients.

Here are some of the common observations we've seen on these projects:

- Almost every project involves building one or more stateful API services, either choosing REST of GraphQL.
- The inability to quickly iterate on APIs harms the agility of front end development.
- Authentication takes too long to build, even if this merely requires integration with a pre-built authentication service.
- Access control is always a business requirement, yet often implemented _ad-hoc_ and late in the development process.
