At JUXT, we choose our technology and approach carefully and we believe that technology choices really do matter. Weâ€™ve all experienced building with poor tools, and the result can be a software project that gets progressively slower and struggles under an ever-growing weight of complexity and subtle bugs. This can kill momentum and be fatal for early-stage startups.

We believe firmly that technologies we use should be <span class='font-bold'> Open</span>, not depending on proprietary agreements and keeping implementation details locked away; <span class='font-bold'> Simple</span>, not conflating concepts that should remain separate, to avoid complexity and maintain agility; <span class='font-bold'> Mature</span>, with a proven longevity and value that is not subject to rapidly changing fashion; <span class='font-bold'> Secure</span>, built with the security considerations of the modern cloud in mind; and <span class='font-bold'> Reliable </span>, since failure of subsystems and components is inevitable in cloud infrastructure, our technologies must be responsive to failure and engineered to maintain service despite it.
